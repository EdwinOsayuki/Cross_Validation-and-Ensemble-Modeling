## Cross_Validation-and-Ensemble-Modeling

The Adult dataset is from the Census Bureau and the task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year based attributes such as education, hours of work per week, etc..
There are two class values in the dataset namely:  ‘>50K‘ and ‘<=50K‘, meaning it is a binary classification task. The classes are imbalanced, with a skew toward the ‘<=50K‘ class label.

‘>50K’: majority class, approximately 25%.
‘<=50K’: minority class, approximately 75%.
